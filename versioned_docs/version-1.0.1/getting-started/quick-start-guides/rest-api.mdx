# RESTful API

## Overview 

There are two main methods of processing payments on the DomPay platform, as described on this page. 

## REST API

The DomPay API is organised around the REST protocol.

Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors.

Payments performed on the Sandbox environment never hit the banking networks and incur no cost.

### Step 1) Set Your Headers

:::info
This section is an example of server-side integration that you can build.
:::

Setting headers is an important component of an API request, the headers must contain two main parameters:

- **Content-Type:** application/json
- **X-User-Secret-Key** for your API Secret Key. 

```http
Content-Type: application/json

x-user-secret-key: {{secretkey}}
```

### Step 2) Set Your Parameters

In order to process a payment via DomPay's API, you first need to create a JSON object with the required parameters.

DomPay's API Reference can be found [here](https://google.com) or in the Navbar above.

```json title="Charge Request with One-Time Token"
{
	"amount":"100",
	"currency":"AUD",
	"token": "{{Your-One-Time-Token}}"
}
```

### Step 3) Send You Payment

Once you have configured your headers and request parameters, it is time to send your payment! 

In the example below we will send a payment with the following conditions:

- ❗  HTTP Method is POST 
- ❗  201 Expected 
- ❗  Approved Required (Set via Visa Test Card) 
- ❗  Payment Source is a One-Time-Token 

```json title="Payment Request"
"Endpoint" : "https://api.dompay.io/v1/charges",

"Content-Type" : "application/json",

"x-user-secret-key": "Your_API_Secret_Key"

{
	"amount":"100",
	"currency":"AUD",
	"token":"2839b39b-1865-4cbb-9387-fb2f3c83c822"
}
```
DomPay will proceed to process your request and provide a JSON reponse accordingly.

**✅  Your successful response includes parameters:**

- **201 Created HTTP Response** 
- **"Status": "Complete"**
- **Comprehensive JSON Response Data**

```json title="Payment Response"
{
    "status": 201,
