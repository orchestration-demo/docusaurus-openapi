# Quick Start Guides

## Overview 

Let’s test out running Plaid locally by cloning the Quickstart app. 

You’ll need API keys, which you can receive by signing up in the Dashboard.

You'll have two different API keys, and there are three different Plaid environments. Today we'll start in the Sandbox environment. 

View the API Keys section of the Dashboard to find your Sandbox secret.
