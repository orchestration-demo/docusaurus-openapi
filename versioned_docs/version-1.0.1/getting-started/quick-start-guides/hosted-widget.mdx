## Overview 

The DomPay API is organised around the Representational State Transfer (REST) protocol.

Our API uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors, and has predictable resource-oriented URLs. 

Payments performed on the Sandbox environment never hit the banking networks, and incur no cost.
