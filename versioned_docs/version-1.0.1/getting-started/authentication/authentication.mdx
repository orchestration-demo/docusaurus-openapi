# Authentication

When sending requests to the DomPay API, you must either provide a public key or a secret key depending on your use case.

The table below will help you determine which API key you should generate:

| Application            | Key Required | Description                                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Client SDK (Widget.js) | Public Key   | The public key is set with a function call.                |
| REST API               | Secret Key   | Secret key is added as a header to the DomPay API request. |

API keys are generated via DomPay's Merchant Dashboard, in three easy steps:

1. Log in to the PowerBoard Merchant Dashboard (Sandbox or Production).
2. Click on the link **'My Company'** and go to the heading **'API and Security'**.
3. On the screen you will see both the public and secret key required to send requests to the DomPay API.
