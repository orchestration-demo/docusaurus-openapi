# Error Handling

DomPay uses HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. 

After submitting an API call to DomPay, you will receive a response to inform you that your request has been received and processed. 

Depending on the HTTP response code of the response, you should build workflow logic to handle all errors that the gateway may return.
